1. Module-1 report work assignment. (Google Drive)
2. Module-1 video-recording.
	a. Emre will work on video editing.
3. Module-2 Aviral's idea discussion
	a. Everyone agreed to work on the idea, VR-One, if it would fullfill module-2 requirements.
4. Discussed suggestions for improving team-management for Module-2. Aviral, Emre, Adam and David agreed on the following suggestions:
	a. No one person will do task-assignment. Tasks would be created in team-meetings mostly in the form of function specifications and posted in 'Github Projects' section. Anyone can work on them.
	b. The person writing the function is responsible for it. They must put their name in the comments and must write unit tests for it before pushing the function branch into the master branch.
	c. Any changes to data-structures/code in the master branch that doesn't belong to the person must be made after discussing with the whole team in the next team meeting. 
5. @Marinah - as you had to leave early please read the meeting minutes and share your thoughts.

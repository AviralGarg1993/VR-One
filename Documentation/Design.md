##Persona (as reference tools!)

Bob, 21 - Third year University Student

"Russian 101 has got to be my GPA booster."

Bob is a Computer Engineering student who is registered in first year Russian course as an arts elective. He is quite enthusiastic about learning this new language and wants to get a decent grade in the course.

VR EXPERIENCE LEVEL: NONE


##General Pointers

1. Ergnomics for VR: Sitting viewing experience not standing.
2. Be mindful of viewing angles during object placement.
3. Be mindful of personal bubble space during object placement.
3. Be mindful of stereo vanishing point for optimization.
4. Avoid skinny font with a light weight for text in VR.
5. Stick to medium and bold weight fonts.
6. It is helpful if your text is fairly large.
7. Be mindful of distance and scaling for text in VR.
8. For best text viewing experience a good distance for text to sit at would be 1 unity unit, which is about 1 meter. (may vary from person to person)
9. Due to pixel density issues it is critical to test text-viewing-experience on the deivce (it is slightly easy to read it on computer screen ).
10. TESTING ON DEVICE for movements is also very important as it may cause dizzyness during VR-experience.


##Ideas for Future Enhancements

1. Teachers use VR-One to create interactive course material.
